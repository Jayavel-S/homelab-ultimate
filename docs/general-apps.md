# General Apps

This package contains some of the commonly self-hosted applications that is useful for many people. 


You will first be asked where to store the applications' data. This will then be updated as the storage location for all the config files.

Example is provided below, you can either go for the same or change as per your needs.

```sh
/data/apps
```

Few things to note:
 -  You should not include the trailing '/' when you type in to the script.
 -  Each application will be created as a sub directory within the specified folder.

>So if you have provided "/data/apps" to be the path, the Snapdrop application will be installed under "/data/apps/snapdrop".

That's it. From now on, it is just a matter of pressing either 'y' or 'n' to the applications to install.

Once you finish making your choices, the script will start by initializing the system updates, followed by Docker, Docker Compose, Portainer and the list of apps chosen.

When the installation completes, I suggest that you visit the Portainer's URL (https://yourip:9443) and set up the admin account.

>Accessing service through a domain

If you like to access any of the application through a domain that you own, you'd need to assign your domain name and point it to the application's port to access it over the internet.

You'd need to setup a proxy host for this domain name and point it to this IP . You can visit this **[document](https://github.com/Jayavel-S/homelab-ultimate/blob/main/docs/nginx-proxy-manager.md)** if you'd like to know how to setup a domain to point to this instance. You will also get a free Let's Encrypt SSL that gets renewed automatically.
