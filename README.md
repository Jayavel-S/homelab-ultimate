<p align="center" >Shell based script to install Docker, and a set of different self-hostable applications compatible with Ubuntu/Debian based systems.</p>

## Prerequisites
  - You need to have an Ubuntu/Debian-based machine.
  - Your instance should have the updated version of 'git' installed. You can check if you have git installed or not by running the command `git version` and looking at the output.
 
       ![git version](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/101336634/158008355-768918e3-7ced-462f-9a9f-e52e539c875b.png)
 - If it returns a value like it shows in this image, then you are all set. If not, you can use the following command to install the latest version of git in your system.
 `sudo apt update && sudo apt install git`
 
 
## Usage

Open Terminal (if using a desktop environment) or Putty/any SSH tool that you use (if using a server environment/headless machine) and connect to your instance. 

1. Download the script by running

```sh 
   wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Jayavel-S/homelab-ultimate/main/install.sh
```

<p>

Just add `sudo` in front.

```sh 
   sudo wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Jayavel-S/homelab-ultimate/main/install.sh
```

</p>
</details>

2. Now, you need to provide 'executable' permissions to it.
```sh 
   sudo chmod +x ./install.sh
```

3. Run the script
```sh 
   ./install.sh
```


## Available Choices

I have included some packages that lets you install and customize the applications to your needs. The available options are:

- [Basic Setup](https://github.com/Jayavel-S/homelab-ultimate/blob/main/docs/basic-setup.md)
- [Nextcloud Package](https://github.com/Jayavel-S/homelab-ultimate/blob/main/docs/nextcloud.md)
- [Website Package](https://github.com/Jayavel-S/homelab-ultimate/blob/main/docs/website-package.md)

Once you make the selection, you might be asked additional questions that helps you tailor this installation to your needs. Make sure to read the prompts carefully and proceed with installation.

Choosing any option will get the default dependencies taken care of (i.e.) the script will install Docker, Docker-Compose and Portainer.
